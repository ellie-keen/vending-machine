# VendingMachine

The aim of this tech test is to emulate the behaviour of a vending machine.

In this case the machine only takes 50p pence coins, only sells water(60p) and crisps(40p) and returns the right amount of change owed plus the list of "bought" items. 

This program should be written to be interacted with via the command line.
